## My notes about the course.


1. I am using c9.io instead of my local computer.  This way it is easy to work on this when I am not sitting at my Mac MINI.
1. When my c9 workspace is serving it is at https://javascript30-payne.c9users.io
1. All the time my solutions are available at http://mattpayne.org/JavaScript30/ because github pages are mapped to my vanity domain.

## Day 1
1. Great tutorial!  Easy to understand and follow along.  I like that c9.io editor has function name completion for javascript.  [My solution](http://mattpayne.org/JavaScript30/01_JavaScript_Drum_Kit/) meets the goals: press keys to hear sounds.   This project makes me think of [Gene in Bob's Burgers sampling many things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5EPhmIdOkc)
